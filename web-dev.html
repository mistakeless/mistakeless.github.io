    <h1>Web Development</h1>

    <h2>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE | HTML/CSS</h2>
    <h3>This site!</h3>
    
    <p class="text-left">A visually arresting static site showcasing my work so far. 
        I took care to include appropriate tags for those using screen readers 
        and avoided using black text on a white background to improve ease of reading for those with dyslexia. 
        Further accessibility updates to come!</p>

    <h2>GENERATIVE SLEEP | HTML/TONE.JS</h2>
    <a href="https://generative-sleep.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Generative Sleep</a>

    <p class="text-left">Generative Sleep is the first version of a web app that is designed for the creation 
        of fully customisable and theoretically infinite ambient music. 
        Our aim is to help people sleep soundly and to empower the user to create a sound palette they find relaxing, 
        giving them the choice to customise sounds as little or as much as they like. 
        This project is a collaboration with Sean Norris. 
        I am responsible for prototyping the music creation algorithms. 
        We present our solutions to one another using Discord video conferencing, give feedback and discuss manageable next steps. 
        We're looking forward to expanding this project's interactivity!</p>

    <h2>HAIKU APP | HTML/CSS/JS</h2>
    <a href="https://haiku-app.surge.sh/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Haiku App</a>
    <p class="text-left">I created this site to practise using JavaScript as part of a web project. It is deployed using Surge.
        The site randomly chooses a time appropriate greeting to display, 
        as well as one of five possible haiku. It also features a sticky footer, 
        screen responsive styling and a script that pauses animations before content has loaded.</p>
